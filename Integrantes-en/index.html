					<td>Yangbo Chen</td>
					<td> Full professor at the School of Geography and Planning at the Sun Yat-sen University, and the Director of Water Disaster Management and Informatics Laboratory. He is the President of the International Commission on Remote Sensing (ICRS) of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), and the Chairman of the IAHS working group on Modeling Hydrological Processes and Changes. His research is focusing on the hydrological model development and its application in flood simulation and forecasting, Land use/cover estimation based on remote sensing images and its application on assessing its impact on hydrological responses. Dr. Chen developed the Liuxihe model, a physically based distributed hydrological model that is widely used in China’s catchment flood forecasting, including the large scale and small scale catchment and reservoir.</td>
